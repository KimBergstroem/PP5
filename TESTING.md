## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

W3C Markup Validation is a service offered by W3C, which enables you to assess the compliance of your HTML code with the official standards. This service identifies syntax errors, improper tag usage, and other issues that might impact the structure and meaning of your web pages. By utilizing W3C Markup Validation, you can ensure that your HTML code is well-structured and conforms to established web standards.

Google Chrome web browser and the 'Inspect' function were used to capture the HTML page from the webb applications templates, which was then validated against the W3C Validator.

In this project, a rich text editor called "Summernote" is used to allow users to create and update posts with HTML content. While Summernote enhances the user experience, it introduces some complexities when validating our HTML code.

When users create or update posts, they have the flexibility to input HTML, which can sometimes lead to unconventional HTML structures or attributes. These unconventional structures are detected as errors when I validate our HTML code using external tools like the W3C validator.

Due to the interaction between Summernote and the need to ensure the security of application. To protect against security threats and potential attacks, implemented safeguards such as using the `|safe` filter in our forms. This filter prevents user-entered HTML from compromising the security of application.

### CSS Validation
[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your HTML and CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility.

### Python Validaton 
[PEP 8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) serves as a comprehensive style guide for writing Python code, emphasizing consistency and readability as its core principles. It offers guidance on code formatting, variable and function naming conventions, and various best practices. Adhering to PEP 8 principles contributes to enhancing code quality, making it more readable and maintainable.

Within the settings file, one URL was identified as being excessively long. The other lines that exceeded the recommended length were automatically generated by Django. All other files were free from errors and issues.

## Accessibility

### **Wave**

[The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to assess the accessibility of the website. WAVE helps identify potential accessibility issues and provides guidance on how to improve the accessibility of web content.

During the evaluation, the following issues were identified:

- **Issue**: Description

- **Issue**: Description


<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/test.md/test-accessibility.png" />
</p>

By using the WAVE tool, I gained valuable insights into the accessibility of my website. While I have chosen not to address certain errors at this time, I remain committed to creating an inclusive user experience and will continue to explore ways to improve accessibility in the future.

## Performance
I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of [The easykeyboardmaker website](https://easykeyboardmaker-ffb468c2d2d7.herokuapp.com/) using [Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/). This evaluation was performed in Google Chrome browser's incognito mode to eliminate all potential impacts from other addons and cached files.

Any detials about error pages etc? These errors have had an impact on the overall performance of these pages:

- Error impacting
- Error impacting
- Error impacting


The performance scores were assessed for both desktop and mobile devices. Below are the summarized results:

### Desktop Performance
- Average performance score: 00/100
- The majority of pages received scores above 00/100, indicating excellent performance.

| **Tested** | **Performance Score** | **View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | :---:
|page.html| 0 / 100 | <details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](IMG)</details> | âœ…


### Mobile Performance
- Average performance score: 00/100
- The pages showed slightly lower performance compared to the desktop but still maintained a satisfactory score.

| **Tested** | **Performance** | **View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | :---:
|page.html| 0 / 100 | <details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](IMG)</details> | âœ…


In terms of performance, Easy Keybaord Maker website delivered strong results, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Automated Testing

Information about the automated testing, if time is available.

How to import the testing:

- `import sys`
- `TEST_APPS = ['app.tests']` 
- `if 'test' in sys.argv or 'test_coverage' in sys.argv:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(
            os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
        )
    }`

&nbsp;

### file.py

![screenshot](IMG)


My initial tests passed without errors, the testing process did reveal some bugs and errors. You can find details about these issues, documented in my readme file, click [here](README.md)

To measure code coverage and assess how much of the project's codebase is tested, I used the Coverage.py tool. Here are the steps to view the coverage report in HTML format:

Installing the Coverage.py using pip
- `Pip install coverage`

To check coverage in the HTML format run in the terminal:

- `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
  - This will create a `.coverage` file in your root directory
- `coverage html`
  - This will create a folder in your root directory called `htmlcov`
  - Right-click on it and select "Open with Live Server" to view the detailed coverage report.


My tests have achieved 89% code coverage, but there's always room for improvement and further testing that can help improve this score.

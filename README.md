# Database
When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the e-commerce application.

# Design
Text

### Design Choices
Text

### Color
Decision to adopt the 60-30-10 rule in our UI design is driven by its ability to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This approach guarantees consistency by allocating 60% of our color palette to the dominant color, fostering brand recognition and trust. The 30% dedicated to the secondary color enables us to strike a visual balance, allowing for variations in content, headers, and backgrounds without overwhelming users. The remaining 10% allocated to the accent color serves to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, though we recommend choosing a contrasting shade for improved visibility and user engagement. This strategy ensures that our web application not only looks appealing but also functions effectively, guiding users to key elements while maintaining a harmonious and dependable design.

# Methodology

The EasyKeyboardMaker project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
The EasyKeyboardMaker project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

### Future Backlog and Progress
The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** 6/19 EXAMPLE FILL IN
- **Should-Have:** 
- **Could-Have:** 
- **Wont-Have:** 
- **Task:**

### User Account Management:
- The account sign-up form allows new users to create an account and join the exclusive deals at the e-commerce. The form has validation to make sure that the user enters the correct information needed. This is a Django built-in validation system. Such validation is:

    - **Username**: Required and has a maximum of 150 characters or fewer. Only letters, digits, and @/./+/-/_ are allowed.
    - **Email**: Required and must be in a valid email format.
    - **Password**: Subject to the following constraints:
        - Cannot be too similar to your other personal information.
        - Must contain at least 8 characters.
        - Cannot be a commonly used password.
        - Cannot be entirely numeric.
    - See Screenshot<details><summary>**SIGNUP VALIDATION**</summary><img src="docs/features/features-blog-form-valid.png"></details>

- The login form ensures secure access to EasyKeyboardMaker by verifying your username and password. If you face login issues, use the 'Forgot Password?' link to reset your password. The form also displays validation error messages to guide you through any input errors.
    - See Screenshot<details><summary>**LOGIN VALIDATION**</summary><img src="docs/features/features-login-validation.png"></details>


- When an account is successfully created, the user will receive a confirmation message and gain access to the profile menu.<details><summary>See Screenshot **Success**</summary><img src="docs/features/features"></details>

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.

     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**

By forking the GitHub Repository, can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. Follow these steps:

 **GitHub Account Setup:**
   - Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.

 **Locate the Repository:**
   - Find the repository at [https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5).

 **Fork the Repository:**
   - At the top right of the repository page, click "Fork" to create a copy in your own GitHub repository.

### Clone of the Repository:

Creating a clone allows you to have a local copy of the project. Follow these steps:

 **Repository URL:**
   - Navigate to [https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5](https://github.com/KimBergstroem/PP5).
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right.

 **Clone the Repository:**
   - Select the "Clone by HTTPS" option and copy the provided URL to the clipboard.

 **Terminal and Git:**

   - Run `git clone` followed by the copied URL.
   - Press enter, and Git will clone the repository to your local machine.


To fork the repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Wait for the forking process to complete. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
